### What does truth and falsely mean (and when does something evaluate to each)

Booleans in JavaScript, like `true` and `false`, are utilized liberally in JavaScript coding. However, some values and types can be considered equivalent to these booleans even if their value is not that data type. 

For this reason, there are values and JavaScript types that can be *truthy* or *falsy* which means that they *emulate* those sorts of values under certain circumstances, like a ternary operator or branching statement.
